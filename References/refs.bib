  abstract     = {An analysis of interrogative semantics that does not reduce questions to mirrors of their answers, but derives them independently via situation semantics. It is shown that previous accounts of queries are deficient in that embedded interrogatives cannot be reduced to the conditions for exhaustive answering. Question resolution is shown to be relative to context, {\&} need not be an exhaustive extension of the queried predicate. An account of resolution is proposed that includes mental states, {\&} goal {\&} inferential capabilities of the agent. A system for formalizing this treatment is introduced that covers declaratives {\&} simple {\&} compound questions, along with semantic rules {\&} syntax based on head driven phrase structure grammar to characterize declaratives, yes/no questions, {\&} wh-questions in a situation semantics. The fact that queries do not require exhaustive resolution is discussed further, {\&} a proposed formalization for potential resolution is applied to example cases. A discussion follows of the use {\&} forces of queries to account for the range of proper responses, including conditions for when responses imply exhaustion {\&} when they merely provide information about the question. An appendix on handling quantifier {\&} wh-phrase scope ambiguities is provided. 5 Figures, 1 Appendix, 78 References. Adapted from the source document},

In this paper, we survey a wide range of research in temporal representation and reasoning, without committing ourselves to the point of view of any specific application. The organization of the paper follows the commonly recognized division of the field in two main subfields: reasoning about actions and change, and reasoning about temporal constraints. We give an overview of the basic issues, approaches, and results in these two areas, and outline relevant recent developments. Furthermore, we briefly analyze the major emerging trends in temporal representation and reasoning as well as the relationships with other well{\&}dash;established areas, such as temporal databases and logic programming.},

  abstract     = {Natural language generation is now moving away from research prototypes into more practical applications. Generation functionality is also being asked to play a more significant role in established applications such as machine translation. In both cases, multilingual generation techniques have much to offer. However, the take-up of multilingual generation is being restricted by a critical lack both of large-scale linguistic resources suited to the generation task and of appropriate development environments. This paper describes KPML, a multilingual development environment that offers one possible solution to these problems. KPML aims to provide generation projects with standardized, broad-coverage, reusable resources and a basic engine for using such resources for generation. A variety of focused debugging aids ensure efficient maintenance, while supporting multilingual work such as contrastive language development and automatic merging of independently developed resources. KPML is based on a new, generic approach to multilinguality in resource description that extends significantly beyond previous approaches. The system has already been used in a number of large generation projects and is freely available to the generation community.},

The study is part a long-term research project concerned with the construal of location in and movement through space in language and other semiotic systems, and it is an exploratory guide sketching part of the findings from the research. Our aims, in addition to reporting findings of the project, are to provide the exploratory guide for both more detailed and more extensive analysis in future studies and thus to stimulate more register-based research in this area. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a "nucleus." A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or "culmination," with a "preparatory process" by which it is accomplished, and a "consequent state," which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural-language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.},

This claim implies that there is (i) an enduring something, (ii) it is native, and (iii) it is under threat from invasive species. I examine these implications in turn, first considering the role of the observer in invasion biology, particularly in preferring a nature characterized by stability rather than flux. Second, I examine the concept of "native" given that humans are thoroughly embedded within ecological systems. Third, I demonstrate how our exclusion of humans conditions us to consider invasive species a primary threat rather than one among many interacting causal agents of global change; in particular, recent evidence indicates that these agents, which include human-caused disturbances and global warming (not to mention human population growth and global trade), may overwhelm the effects of invasive species per se. For these and other reasons, some ecologists have argued that ecological change is inevitable and that our concerns about invasive species are unjustified. I discuss these issues and suggest ways for ecologists to conduct engaged research through appropriate advocacy and engagement with stakeholders dealing with local invasive species.},

Meaning, they propose, does not exist solely within words and sentences but resides largely in the situation and the attitudes brought to it by those involved. They present a witty and clear treatment of important innovations in the field of natural semantics, contending that the standard view of logic (as derived from Frege, Russell, and work in mathematics and logic) is inappropriate for many of the uses to which it has been put by scholars. In Situations and Attitudes they provide the basics of a realistic model-theoretic semantics of natural language, explain the main ideas of the theory, and contrast them with those of competing theories.

This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize.},

  abstract  = {We investigate a number of approaches to generating Stanford Dependencies, a widely used semantically-oriented dependency representation. We examine algorithms specifically designed for dependency parsing (Nivre, Nivre Eager, Covington, Eisner, and RelEx) as well as dependencies extracted from constituent parse trees created by phrase structure parsers (Charniak, Charniak-Johnson, Bikel, Berkeley and Stanford). We found that phrase structure parsers systematically outperform algorithms designed specifically for dependency parsing. The most accurate method for generating dependencies is the Charniak-Johnson reranking parser, with 89 {\%} (labeled) attachment F1 score. The fastest methods are Nivre, Nivre Eager, and Covington. When used with a linear classifier to make local parsing decisions, these methods can parse the entire Penn Treebank development set (section 22) in less than 10 seconds on an Intel Xeon E5520. However, this speed comes with a substantial drop in F1 score (about 76 {\%} for labeled attachment) compared to competing methods. By tuning how much of the search space is explored by the Charniak-Johnson parser, we are able to arrive at a balanced configuration that is both fast and nearly as good as the most accurate approaches. 1.},

The organization provided training data in the form of a pre-processed Semcor which could be readily used by participants. The task had two participants, and the organizer also provided an in-house WSD system for comparison. The results do not improve over the baseline, which is not surprising given the simplistic CLIR strategy used.

This turns upon the notion of illocutionary silencing, or disablement.

In this paper we show that despite the un- orthodox organisation of SFG, adapting ex- isting resources remains the most practical way to create an annotated corpus. We present and analyse SFGBank, an automated conversion of the Penn Treebank into sys- temic functional grammar.

  title        = {{Automating class definitions from OWL to English}},
  abstract     = {Text definitions for entities within bio-ontologies are a cor-nerstone of the effort to gain a consensus in understanding and usage of those ontologies. Writing these definitions is, however, a considerable effort and there is often a lag be-tween specification of the entities in the ontology and the development of the text-based definitions. As well as these text definitions, there can also be logical descriptions and definitions of an ontology's entities. The goal of natural lan-guage generation (NLG) from ontologies is to take the logi-cal description of entities and generate fluent natural lan-guage. We should be able to use NLG to automatically pro-vide text-based definitions from an ontology that has logical descriptions of its entities and thus avoid the bottleneck of authoring these definitions by hand. In this paper we present some early work in using NLG to provide such text definitions for the Experimental factor Ontology (EFO).

For such purposes, we argue that dependency schemes must follow a simple design and provide semantically contentful information, as well as offer an automatic procedure to extract the relations. We consider the underlying design principles of the Stanford scheme from this perspective, and compare it to the GR and PARC representations. Finally, we address the question of the suitability of the Stanford scheme for parser evaluation.},

  abstract  = {Representing dynamic information in the form of ontologies, as well as querying and reasoning over static and dynamic ontologies are the areas of interest in this work. Building upon well established standards of the semantic Web and the 4D-fluents approach for representing the evolution of temporal information in ontologies, SOWL illustrates how spatial and spatio-temporal information and evolution in space and time can be efficiently represented in OWL. It also demonstrates how qualitative temporal and spatial relations that are common in natural language expressions (i.e., rela- tions between time intervals like “before”, “after”, etc.) are represented in the ontology. Existing approaches allow for representations of only static, spatial or temporal informa- tion, but do not support combinations on the nature of in- formation or representation of qualitative relations. Part of the proposed representation model is the SOWL (high-level) query language, which does not require users to be familiar with peculiarities of the underlying ontology representation (which can be complex) and handles ontologies similar to relational databases. A distinct feature of SOWL is the in- corporation spatio-temporal reasoning in SOWL, which is capable of inferring spatio-temporal information from rep- resentations in the underlying ontology model. 1.},

Then we introduce the DOLCE upper-level ontology, which is inspired by such principles but with a clear orientation toward language and cognition. We report the results of an experimental effort to align WORDNET'S upper level with DOLCE. We suggest that such alignment could lead to an "ontologically sweetened" WORD-NET, meant to be conceptually more rigorous, cognitively transparent, and efficiently exploitable in several applications.},

The first part of the book sets out alternate ways in which verbs can express their arguments. The second presents classes of verbs that share a kernel of meaning and explores in detail the behavior of each class, drawing on the alternations in the first part. Levin's discussion of each class and alternation includes lists of relevant verbs, illustrative examples, comments on noteworthy properties, and bibliographic references. The result is an original, systematic picture of the organization of the verb inventory.

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce{\textless}tex{\textgreater}n{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing{\textless}tex{\textgreater}n{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

But since we do not know what conceptual resources we might need to express our future theories or to provide our best future faithful descriptions of the world, we do not now know even what the space of future descriptive options might be. One strategy for addressing this shifting-resource problem is to track the predictive and linguistic dispositions of inquirers rather than to track their theories and conceptual resources directly. Sender-predictor games, a variant of Skyrms–Lewis sender-receiver games, provide very simple models for the coordinated coevolution of predictive and linguistic dispositions. Such models explain how it is possible for (1) predictive and descriptive dispositions of inquirers to coevolve, (2) term-wise incommensurable, but nevertheless descriptively faithful languages, to sequentially evolve, and (3) a sort of underdetermination to occur where inquirers might satisfy their descriptive and predictive aims by revising their linguistic dispositions, their theoretical dispositions, or both. Such models also provide an elementary characterization of what it might mean for descriptions of the world to be faithful and hence for empirical inquiry to be successful. In doing so they provide a relatively weak, but perfectly clear, endogenous account of epistemic norms.},

  abstract  = {We propose an approach for reasoning and querying over temporal information in OWL ontologies. Representing both qualitative temporal (i.e., information whose temporal extents are unknown such as “before”, “after” for temporal relations) in addition to quantitative information (i.e., where temporal information is defined precisely e.g., using dates) is a distinctive feature of the proposed ontology. Qualitative representations are very common in natural language expressions such as in free text or speech and can be proven to be valuable in the Semantic Web. Reasoning rules applying over temporal relations, infer implied relations, detect inconsistencies and retain soundness, completeness and tractability over the supported sets of relations using path consistency. Temporal representations are defined on time instants rather than on intervals (as it is typical in the literature), resulting into simpler yet equivalent representations. A SPARQL-based temporal query language capable of exploiting the characteristics of the underlying representation is also implemented and discussed.},

  abstract  = {Ontology generation and population is a crucial part of knowl- edge base construction and maintenance that enables us to relate text to ontologies, providing a rich and customised ontology related to the data and domain with which we are concerned. SPRAT combines aspects from traditional named entity recognition, ontology-based information extraction and relation extraction, in order to identify patterns for the extraction of a variety of entity types and relations between them, and to re-engineer them into concepts and instances in an ontology. When aug- mented with richer knowledge such as WordNet semantic categories and terminological information, the results are greatly improved. SPRAT can either modify an existing ontology or create a new ontology from scratch, which is speci c to the corpus of texts processed. Preliminary results are very promising, although more re nement of the patterns is still neces- sary.},

The following section explores in some detail the logical and formal foundations of the descriptive apparatus, centered on the crucial ontological distinction between, on the one hand, formal objects embodying the properties of linguistic expressions, and on the other, descriptions of those objects. We conclude with a review of HPSG-based processing, including the motivations behind such work, the different computational approaches and systems, as well as current strands of research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

In systemic functional linguistics, language is viewed as a meaning potential, thus embracing the view, now supported by contemporary theories of the evolution of human consciousness, that language has evolved in the living of life in society. Using the theoretical framework of systemic functional linguistics, the chapters of this book explore the nature of language, the relations of meaning and society, of form and meaning, and of grammar and lexis. Halliday has referred to the level of lexicogrammar as the powerhouse of language: this is where the resource for creating linguistic meaning resides. But language as resource cannot be adequately described as a set of syntagmatic structures; instead, the primary focus must be on the paradigmatic axis, which after all furnishes the principle for the actualisation of syntagms. Accordingly, aspects of Urdu and English semantics, grammar and lexis are presented here in terms of systemic options, realised as structures.},

The copious exercises have been revised to increase potential for creativty and flexibility of approach. New exericases highlight further controversial issues.

First, by representing the learned knowledge at a meta-level in the form of instantiated model- ing primitives within a so called Probabilistic Ontology Model (POM), we remain independent of a concrete target language while being able to translate the instantiated primitives into any (reasonably expressive) knowledge representation formalism. Second, user interaction is a core as- pect of Text2Onto and the fact that the system calculates a confidence for each learned object allows to design sophisticated visualizations of the POM. Third, by incorporating strategies for data-driven change dis- covery, we avoid processing the whole corpus from scratch each time it changes, only selectively updating the POM according to the corpus changes instead. Besides increasing efficiency in this way, it also allows a user to trace the evolution of the ontology with respect to the changes in the underlying corpus.},

While the classes included are extensive enough for some NLP use, they are not comprehensive. Korhonen and Briscoe (2004) have proposed a significant extension of Levin?s classification which incorporates 57 novel classes for verbs not covered (comprehensively) by Levin. Korhonen and Ryant (unpublished) have recently proposed another extension including 53 additional classes. This article describes the integration of these two extensions into VN. The result is a comprehensive Levin-style classification for English verbs providing over 90{\%} token coverage of the Proposition Bank data (Palmer et al. 2005) and thus can be highly useful for practical applications.},

In this paper, we aim to develop efficient techniques to retrieve graphs, containing a given query graph, from a large set of graphs. Considering the problem of testing subgraph isomorphism is generally NP-hard, most of the existing techniques are based on the framework of filtering-and-verification to reduce the precise computation costs; consequently various novel feature-based indexes have been developed. While the existing techniques work well for small query graphs, the verification phase becomes a bottleneck when the query graph size increases. Motivated by this, in the paper we firstly propose a novel and efficient algorithm for testing subgraph isomorphism, QuickSI. Secondly, we develop a new feature-based index technique to accommodate QuickSI in the filtering phase. Our extensive experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed techniques, which significantly improve the existing techniques.},

It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language-syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system.},

Statistical relational learning builds on ideas from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic, databases and programming languages to represent structure. In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues. Numerous applications are provided throughout.Lise Getoor is Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland.

The two experts in charge of the coding followed a strict protocol, which takes into account both the previous mistakes encountered by prior research into prominence detection in French and elements of the methodology followed by scholars working on other languages. We conclude by discussing the average consistency between the two transcribers. The results obtained are quite encouraging, as the F-measure between the two annotators reaches 82.8$\backslash${\%}, and the kappa-score 0.77.},

  volume       = {2},
  number       = {Suppl 2},
  pages        = {S5},
  abstract     = {Background: Text definitions for entities within bio-ontologies are a cornerstone of the effort to gain a consensus in understanding and usage of those ontologies. Writing these definitions is, however, a considerable effort and there is often a lag between specification of the main part of an ontology (logical descriptions and definitions of entities) and the development of the text-based definitions. The goal of natural language generation (NLG) from ontologies is to take the logical description of entities and generate fluent natural language. The application described here uses NLG to automatically provide text-based definitions from an ontology that has logical descriptions of its entities, so avoiding the bottleneck of authoring these definitions by hand. Results: To produce the descriptions, the program collects all the axioms relating to a given entity, groups them according to common structure, realises each group through an English sentence, and assembles the resulting sentences into a paragraph, to form as coherent a text as possible without human intervention. Sentence generation is accomplished using a generic grammar based on logical patterns in OWL, together with a lexicon for realising atomic entities. We have tested our output for the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) using a simple survey strategy to explore the fluency of the generated text and how well it conveys the underlying axiomatisation. Two rounds of survey and improvement show that overall the generated English definitions are found to convey the intended meaning of the axiomatisation in a satisfactory manner. The surveys also suggested that one form of generated English will not be universally liked; that intrusion of too much formal ontology was not liked; and that too much explicit exposure of OWL semantics was also not liked. Conclusions: Our prototype tools can generate reasonable paragraphs of English text that can act as definitions. The definitions were found acceptable by our survey and, as a result, the developers of EFO are sufficiently satisfied with the output that the generated definitions have been incorporated into EFO. Whilst not a substitute for hand-written textual definitions, our generated definitions are a useful starting point. Availability: An on-line version of the NLG text definition tool can be found at http://swat.open.ac.uk/tools/. The questionaire and sample generated text definitions may be found at http://mcs.open.ac.uk/nlg/SWAT/bio-ontologies.html.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes an algorithm for the interpretation of temporal relations between events mentioned in narrative (such as which event occurs before another). These relations are decided through three different levels of linguistic concepts: aspectual information for verbs, time relations for tenses, and time relations between clauses and/or sentences. One contribution of this paper is to present a more rigorous description for time relations of tenses, which is able to express all the 16 tenses in English and incorporate the interval properties of events from the aspectual analysis into the tense relations. For interpreting time relations between clauses, we emphasize the use of anaphoric references to events and introduce the concept of a situational description for an event (including the participants, place, time duration, etc.), used to make the interpreting algorithm deterministic, i.e. the set of interpreting rules are applied in a fixed order rather than in parallel. Last, we suggest a tree-like structure for the representation of temporal relations between events, which allows us to include vaguely specified relations (which may be clarified later), to facilitate the interpretation of subsequent temporal relations.},

  abstract     = {Complex, non-additive genetic interactions are common and can be critical in determining phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and similar statistical studies of linkage data, however, assume additive models of gene interactions in looking for genotype-phenotype associations. These statistical methods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of influences of each gene and often miss a substantial part of the heritable effect. Such methods do not use any biological knowledge about underlying mechanisms. Modeling approaches from the artificial intelligence (AI) field that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform statistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic analysis. We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical analysis. Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we can replicate the results of traditional statistical methods, but we also show that we are able to go beyond finding independent markers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference without an independence assumption. The method is applied to genetic data on yeast sporulation, a complex phenotype with gene interactions. In addition to detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation, our method identifies four loci with smaller effects. Since their effect on sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do not account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions. We show how gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be used as a general framework for incorporating systems biology with genetics.},

  title       = {{A Corpus-Trained Parser for Systemic-Functional Syntax}},
  type        = {PhD},
  school = {University of Leeds},
  abstract    = {This thesis presents a language engineering approach to the development of a tool for the parsing of relatively unrestricted English text, as found in spoken natural language corpora. Parsing unrestricted English requires large-scale lexical and grammatical resources, and an algorithm for combining the two to assign syntactic structures to utterances of the language. The grammatical theory adopted for this purpose is systemic functional grammar (SFG), despite the fact that it is traditionally used for natural language generation. The parser will use a probabilistic systemic functional syntax (Fawcett 1981, Souter 1990), which was originally employed to hand-parse the Polytechnic of Wales corpus (Fawcett and Perkins 1980, Souter 1989), a 65,000 word transcribed corpus of children's spoken English. Although SFG contains mechanisms for representing semantic as well as syntactic choice in NL generation, the work presented here focuses on the parallel task of obtaining syntactic structures for sentences, and not on retrieving a full semantic interpretation. The syntactic language model can be extracted automatically from the Polytechnic of Wales corpus in a number of formalisms, including 2,800 simple context-free rules (Souter and Atwell 1992). This constitutes a very large formal syntax language, but still contains gaps in its coverage. Some of these are accounted for by a mechanism for expanding the potential for co-ordination and subordination beyond that observed in the corpus. However, at the same time the set of syntax rules can be reduced in size by allowing optionality in the rules. Alongside the context-free rules (which capture the largely horizontal relationships between the mother and daughter constituents in a tree), a vertical trigram model is extracted from the corpus, controlling the vertical relationships between possible grandmothers, mothers and daughters in the parse tree, which represent the alternating layers of elements of structure and syntactic units in SFG. Together, these two models constitute a quasi-context-sensitive syntax. A probabilistic lexicon also extracted from the POW corpus proved inadequate for unrestricted English, so two alternative part-of-speech tagging approaches were investigated. Firstly, the CELEX lexical database was used to provide a large-scale word tagging facility. To make the lexical database compatible with the corpus-based grammar, a hand-crafted mapping was applied to the lexicon's theory neutral grammatical description. This transformed the lexical tags into systemic functional grammar labels, providing a harmonised probabilistic lexicon and grammar. Using the CELEX lexicon, the parser has to do the work of lexical disambiguation. This overhead can be removed with the second approach: The Brill tagger trained on the POW corpus can be used to assign unambiguous labels (with over 92{\%} success rate) to the words to be parsed. While tagging errors do compromise the success rate of the parser, these are outweighed by the search time saved by introducing only one tag per word. A probabilistic chart parsing program which integrated the reduced context-free syntax, the vertical trigram model, with either the SFG lexicon or the POW trained Brill tagger was implemented and tested on a sample of the corpus. Without the vertical trigram model and using CELEX lexical look-up, results were extremely poor, with combinatorial explosion in the syntax preventing any analyses being found for sentences longer than five words within a practical time span. The seemingly unlimited potential for vertical recursion in a context-free rule model of systemic functional syntax is a severe problem for a standard chart parser. However, with addition of the Brill tagger and vertical trigram model, the performance is markedly improved. The parser achieves a reasonably creditable success rate of 76{\%}, if the criteria for success are liberally set at at least one legitimate SF syntax tree in the first six produced for the given test data. While the resulting parser is not suitable for real-time applications, it demonstrates the potential for the use of corpus-derived probabilistic syntactic data in parsing relatively unrestricted natural language, including utterances with ellipted elements, unfinished constituents, and constituents without a syntactic head. With very large syntax models of this kind, the problem of multiple solutions is common, and the modified chart parser presented here is able to produce correct or nearly correct parses in the first few it finds. Apart from the implementation of a parser for systemic functional syntax, the re-usable method by which the lexical look-up, syntactic and parsing resources were obtained is a significant contribution to the field of computational linguistics.},

Such corpora are beginning to serve as important research tools for investigators in natural language processing, speech recognition, and integrated spoken language systems, as well as in theoretical linguistics. Annotated corpora promise to be valu- able for enterprises as diverse as the automatic construction of statistical models for the grammar of the written and the colloquial spoken language, the development of explicit formal theories of the differing grammars of writing and speech, the investi- gation of prosodic phenomena in speech, and the evaluation and comparison of the adequacy of parsing models.},

The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.},

    abstract="Systemic functional theory embodies a multilingual perspective to language from its earliest formulation. However, it was not until the last two decades that descriptions of languages other than English, particularly in the light of language typology, garnered much interest among scholars working with systemic theory. The objective of the present study is to survey the growing literature in this field. The survey consists of two main parts. The first part discusses theoretical developments in relation to language description and typology. The second part presents a meta-analysis of empirical studies in the field. The meta-analysis examines the historical progress in systemic typology and description of non-Anglo languages, the coverage of descriptions in terms of areal and genetic language families, mode of publication and, finally, methodological procedures employed by the studies. Challenges arising from these analytical decisions are also examined. The motivation for the study is to provide a state of the art review of the field in order to guide new descriptions and draw implications for further research in functional language typology, in general, and systemic typology, in particular.",

    abstract="The availability of annotated data (with as rich and ``deep'' annotation as possible) is desirable in any new developments. Textual data are being used for so-called training phase of various empirical methods solving various problems in the field of computational linguistics. While there are many methods that use texts in their plain (or raw) form (in most cases for so-called unsupervised training), more accurate results may be obtained if annotated corpora are available. The data annotation itself is a complex task. While morphologically annotated corpora (pioneered by Henry Ku{\v{c}}era in the 60's) are now available for English and other languages, syntactically annotated corpora are rare. Inspired by the Penn Treebank, the most widely used syntactically annotated corpus of English, we decided to develop a similarly sized corpus of Czech with a rich annotation scheme.",
