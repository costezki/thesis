# Referencing
* Also fix your referencing style: yours appears to be a mixture. Standards are either 2002: 43 or 2002, p. 42 ... not sure what yours is.
* Cite either Halliday1961-orig or Halliday2002 that is a reprint.
* search for "the table" "the figure" "the definition" "the generalisation" and remove "the"

# Introduction
* So we've had all these definitions and still no real idea about how a systemic network is used to generate structures. Without that, it 
will be completely impossible to understand why parsing/generation are asymmetric. I'd suggest a basic example going through a network and producing a structure: then you can refer to this when you introduce complexity. Deriving complexity from your definitions would not be straightforward (and is probably why SFL-folks did not realise the consequences of the paradigmatic orientation).

# In Chaper 2
* in "element of structure" and "componence" sections. Define pivotal element and stress its importance in furtehr discussion and relation to head element. fawcett2000 p195-196, 201, 207 
* in "relaxing the rank scale" point out to sub-structure relation ifg p 388-390, 
* in "syntactic/semantic heads" bring on board ifg4. p390-396.
