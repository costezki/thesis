# Referencing
* Also fix your referencing style: yours appears to be a mixture. Standards are either 2002: 43 or 2002, p. 42 ... not sure what yours is.
* Cite either Halliday1961-orig or Halliday2002 that is a reprint.
* search for "the table" "the figure" "the definition" "the generalisation" and remove "the"

# Introduction
* So we've had all these definitions and still no real idea about how a systemic network is used to generate structures. Without that, it 
will be completely impossible to understand why parsing/generation are asymmetric. I'd suggest a basic example going through a network and producing a structure: then you can refer to this when you introduce complexity. Deriving complexity from your definitions would not be straightforward (and is probably why SFL-folks did not realise the consequences of the paradigmatic orientation).

# In Chaper 2
* in "element of structure" and "componence" sections. Define pivotal element and stress its importance in furtehr discussion and relation to head element. fawcett2000 p195-196, 201, 207 
* in "relaxing the rank scale" point out to sub-structure relation ifg p 388-390, 
* in "syntactic/semantic heads" bring on board ifg4. p390-396.

* JB about introduction to "Critical discussion of the grammatical units": if this is what you meant: I wasn't sure. It would be good if you made this theme stronger also in the previous sections, perhaps with a concluding paragraph for each section spelling out what you take from where and what this helps with in terms of the parsing goal. That would give the entire chapter a much tighter structure and lead the reader through more effectively.

* JB on "Verbal group discussion" (similar to comment above) : Note that you will have to say upfront in the introduction, that because you have adopted as a task that you will be taking SFG, this will necessitate you discussing certain theory internal details and approaches: this has to be made clear otherwise someone from a different theoretical orientation will wonder why (in some places) the accounts are tying themselves in knots and why you are bothering to tell us this stuff. It is, in short, all in the framing: you have to make sure all the way through that it is you who sets the frame, rather than leaving a reader, potentially an uncooperative reader, to come up with their own divergent take on what you explaining.
* JB in the conclussion of the "SFG chapter" I suggest you put the complexity discussion next, so as to motivate talking about phrase structure backbones, DG and GBT at all.

# In Chapter 3
* JB on intro: So, as mentioned in the previous comments, by the time we get to this chapter it would be good if you have established the utility/need for discussing dependency grammars. You should have brought out in your discussions of the limitations of previous attempts to parse with SFGs that dependency was somehow not treated and this makes for problems. Then the reader is all ready to hear about dependency (and later GBT) as a potential solution.
* JB on writing an intro to Ch3: Before this, you will need to have written again in summary just why you are going to take this route, whenever possible writing 'As we have seen', etc.
